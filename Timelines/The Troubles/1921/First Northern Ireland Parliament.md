The [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|1920 Government of Ireland Bill]] created the state of [[Northern Ireland]], which consisted of the six northeastern counties of [[Londonderry]], [[Tyrone]], [[Fermanagh]], [[Antrim]], [[Down]] and [[Armagh]]. From 1921 to 1972, [[Northern Ireland]] was governed by a [[Unionist]] government, based at [[Stormont]] in east [[Belfast]]. Unionist leader and first Prime Minister, [[James Craig]], declared that it would be "a Protestant State for a Protestant People". Craig's goal was to form and preserve Protestant authority in the new state which was above all an effort to secure a unionist majority. In 1926 the majority of the population in the province were Presbyterian and Anglican, therefore, solidifying Craig's Protestant political power. The Ulster Unionist Party thereafter formed every government until 1972.
