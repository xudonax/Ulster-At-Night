The **border campaign** (12 December 1956 â€“ 26 February 1962) was a guerrilla warfare campaign (codenamed **Operation Harvest**) carried out by the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) against targets in [[Northern Ireland]], with the aim of overthrowing British rule there and creating a united [[Ireland]]. It was also referred to as the "resistance campaign" by some [[Irish republican]] activists. The campaign was a military failure, but for some of its members was justified as it kept the IRA engaged for another generation.
