The **Government of Ireland Act 1914** (4 & 5 Geo. 5 c. 90), also known as the **Home Rule Act**, and before enactment as the **Third Home Rule Bill**, was an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom intended to provide [[home rule]] (self-government within the United Kingdom) for Ireland. It was the third such bill introduced by a Liberal government during a 28-year period in response to agitation for Irish Home Rule.
