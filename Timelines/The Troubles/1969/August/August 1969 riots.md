During 12â€“16 August 1969, there was an outbreak of political and sectarian violence throughout Northern Ireland, which is often seen as the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles. There had been sporadic violence throughout the year arising out of the Northern Ireland civil rights campaign, which demanded an end to discrimination against [[Catholic|Catholics]] and Irish nationalists. Civil rights marches had been attacked by Protestant loyalists, and protesters often clashed with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)]], the overwhelmingly Protestant police force.

## Timeline
> [!timeline|t-l] **12 August**
> The [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]], an organisation similar to the [[Orange Order]], wished to stage its traditional march in Londonderry. Early skirmishes between [[Catholic|Catholics]] and [[Protestant|Protestants]] escalated into what would came to be known as the [[August 1969 riots#Battle of the Bogside|Battle of the Bogside]].
>
>It took the form of pitched battles between police and local men and youths using petrol bombs, bricks, and any other missiiles they could find to prevent the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from entering the district.

> [!timeline|t-r] **13 August**
> In support of the Bogsiders, Catholics/nationalists held protests elsewhere in Northern Ireland, some of which led to violence. The bloodiest clashes were in [[Belfast]], where seven people were killed and hundres wounded. Five of them were Catholic civilians shot by the police. Protesters clashed with both the police and with loyalists, who attacked Catholic districts.

> [!timeline|t-l] **14 August**
> The [[British Army]] was deployed to restore order on 14 August, beginning the thirty-seven year [[Operation Banner]], and [[Peace Walls|peace lines]] were built to separate Catholic and Protestant districts. The [[Republic of Ireland]]'s government set up field hospitals and refugee centres near the Irish border, and called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be sent to Northern Ireland.

> [!timeline|t-r] **15 August**
> The morning of 15 August saw many Catholic families in central [[Belfast]] flee to Andersonstown to escape the rioting. Violence continued on multiple places in the country.

> [!timeline|t-l] **16 August**
> On the evening of 16 August the British Army was deployed on Crumlin Road. Thereafter, the violence died down into what the Scarman report called "the quiet of exhaustion".

## Battle of the Bogside
The **Battle of the Bogside** was a large three-day riot that took place from 12 to 14 August 1969 in [[Derry]]. Thousands of Catholic/Irish nationalist residents of the Bogside district, organised under the [[Derry Citizens' Defence Association]], clashed with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and loyalists.
