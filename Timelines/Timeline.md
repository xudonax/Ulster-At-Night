Let's show a timeline!

> [!timeline|t-l] **400AD-800AD** _[[Early Christian Ireland]]_
> The early medieval history of Ireland, often referred to as [[Early Christian Ireland]], spans the 5th to 8th centuries, from the gradual emergence out of the protohistoric period (Ogham inscriptions in Primitive Irish, mentions in Greco-Roman ethnography) to the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].

> [!timeline|t-r] **Roughly 664** _[[Plague of 664]]_
> The plague of 664 was an epidemic that affected Britain and Ireland in 664 AD, during the first plague pandemic. It was the first recorded epidemic in English history, and coincided with a solar eclipse. It was considered by later sources as "The Yellow Plague of 664" and said to have lasted for twenty or twenty-five years, causing widespread mortality, social disruption and abandonment of religious faith.

+ 400-800 AD
+ Early Christian Ireland
+ The early medieval history of Ireland, often referred to as [[Early Christian Ireland]], spans the 5th to 8th centuries, from the gradual emergence out of the protohistoric period (Ogham inscriptions in Primitive Irish, mentions in Greco-Roman ethnography) to the beginning of the [[Viking Age]]. The period notably includes the Hiberno-Scottish mission of Christianised Ireland to regions of pagan Great Britain and the spread of Irish cultural influence to Continental Europe.

+ 664 AD
+ Plague of 664
+ According to the Irish [[Annals of Tigernach]], the plague was preceded by a solar eclipse on 1 May 664 (the path of the total eclipse on 1 May 664 started in the Pacific, crossed the Gulf of Mexico, swept along the eastern coast of North America crossed Ireland and Scotland and continued on into Central Europe). Bede also mentioned the eclipse but wrongly placed it on 3 May. The Irish sources claimed that there was also an earthquake in Britain and that the plague reached Ireland first at Mag Nitha, among the Fothairt in Leinster. Bede claimed that the plague first was in the south of Britain and then spread to the north.
